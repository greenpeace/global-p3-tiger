                <p>Thank you for using Pinterest! We wrote this policy to help you understand what information we collect, how we use it, and what choices you have. Because we’re an internet company, some of the concepts below are a little technical, but we’ve tried our best to explain things in a simple and clear way. We welcome your <a target="_top" href="https://support.pinterest.com/anonymous_requests/new">questions and comments</a> on this policy.</p>
              

              

              
              
              

              
              
              
            
            
              
                <h3>What information do we collect?</h3>
              
              
              
              
              

              

              
              
              

              
              
              
            
            
              
              
              
              
              
                <p>We collect information in two ways:</p>
              

              

              
              
              

              
              
              
            
            
              
              
              
                <h4>1. When you give it to us or give us permission to obtain it.</h4>
              
              
              

              

              
              
              

              
              
              
            
            
              
              
              
              
              
                <p>When you sign up for or use our products, you voluntarily give us certain information. This can include your name, profile photo, pins, comments, likes, email address you used to sign up, and any other information you provide us. If you’re using Pinterest on your mobile device, you can also choose to provide us with location data.</p>
              

              

              
              
              

              
              
              
            
            
              
              
              
              
              
                <p>You also may give us permission to access your information in other services. For example, you may link your Facebook or Twitter account to Pinterest, which allows us to obtain information from those accounts (e.g., your friends or contacts). The information we obtain from those services often depends on your settings or their privacy policies, so be sure to check what those are.</p>
              

              

              
              
              

              
              
              
            
            
              
              
              
                <h4>2. We also get technical information when you use our products or use websites or apps that have Pinterest features.</h4>
              
              
              

              

              
              
              

              
              
              
            
            
              
              
              
              
              
                <p>These days, whenever you use a website, mobile application, or other Internet service, there’s certain information that almost always gets created and recorded automatically. The same is true when you use our products. Here are some of the types of information we collect:</p>
              

              

              
              
              

              
              
              
            
            
              
              
              
              
              

              

              
              
              

              
              
                <ul class="hazBullet">
                  
                    <li>Log Data. When you use Pinterest or go to a webpage or use an app that has Pinterest features (like our “Pin It” button), our servers automatically record information (“log data”) including information that your browser sends whenever you visit a website or your mobile app sends when you’re using it. This log data may include your Internet Protocol address, the address of the web pages you visited that had Pinterest features, browser type and settings, the date and time of your request, how you used Pinterest, and cookie data.</li>
                  
                    <li>Cookie data. Depending on how you’re accessing our products, we may use “cookies” (a small text file sent by your computer each time you visit our website, unique to your Pinterest account or your browser), or similar technologies to record log data. When we use cookies, we may use “session” cookies (that last until you close your browser) or “persistent” cookies (that last until you or your browser delete them). For example, we may use cookies to store your language preferences or other Pinterest settings so you don‘t have to set them up every time you visit Pinterest. Some of the cookies we use are associated with your Pinterest account (including personal information about you, such as the email address you gave us), and other cookies are not.</li>
                  
                    <li>Device Information. In addition to log data, we may also collect information about the device you’re using Pinterest on, including what type of device it is, what operating system you’re using, device settings, unique device identifiers, and crash data. Whether we collect some or all of this information often depends on what type of device you’re using and its settings. For example, different types of information are available depending on whether you’re using a Mac or a PC, or an iPhone or an Android phone. To learn more about what information your device makes available to us, please also check the policies of your device manufacturer or software provider.</li>

                <h3>How do we use the information we collect?</h3>
              
              
              
              
              

              

              
              
              

              
              
              
            
            
              
              
              
              
              
                <p>We use the information we collect to provide our products to you and make them better, develop new products, and protect Pinterest and our users. For example, we may log how often people use two different versions of a product, which can help us understand which version is better.</p>

For example, depending on your email notification settings, we may send you weekly updates that include pins you may like. You can decide to stop getting these updates by updating your account settings (or through other settings we may provide).</li>

                    <li>Link or unlink your Pinterest account from an account on another service (e.g., Facebook or Twitter). For some services (like Facebook), you can also choose whether or not to publish your activity on Pinterest to that service.</li>
                  
                    <li>Create or be added to a secret board. Secret boards are visible to you and other participants in the board, and any participant may choose to make the contents of the board available to anyone else. For example, another participant may invite someone else to the board, make the board available to an app they use to view Pinterest, or even just take an image from the board and email it to their friends.

                    <li>Choose whether Pinterest will be customized for you using information from off-Pinterest websites or apps. If you have a Pinterest account and don’t want your off-Pinterest data to be used to tailor your experience, you can visit your <a target="_top" href="https://pinterest.com/settings/">account settings</a> and update your “Personalization” preferences. If you don’t have a Pinterest account, or don’t want us to customize Pinterest for you when you’re signed out, you can opt out <a target="_top" href="https://help.pinterest.com/entries/25010303-How-does-Pinterest-use-data-about-other-websites-I-visit-">here</a>.</li>

                    <li>Close your account at any time. When you close your account, we’ll deactivate it and remove your pins and boards from Pinterest. We may retain archived copies of your information as required by law or for legitimate business purposes (including to help address fraud and spam).</li>
