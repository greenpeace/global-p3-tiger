	<h2>2013</h2>

Olam's&nbsp; involvement in illegal timber trade was first detailed in our <a href="https://p3-admin.greenpeace.org/international/en/publications/reports/carving-up-the-congo-exec/"> Carving up the Congo report</a> published earlier this year. The report illustrated how Olam was holding forest land in the Congo granted in breach of a <a href="http://www.greenpeace.org.uk/blog/forests/when-is-a-moratorium-not-a-moratorium" target="_top"> moratorium on the granting of new logging titles</a>, which the World Bank itself had helped to establish. It also described how Olam was sourcing timber from destructive and illegal operations through de-facto subcontracting agreements with third-party suppliers involved in illegal logging. <a href="https://p3-admin.greenpeace.org/international/en/news/features/world-bank-cuts-olam-funding-121207/"> More.</a></p>
<p><strong>December 2007: </strong>The <strong>Irish Government announces</strong> what will be <strong>the EU's first ban</strong> on energy-wasting <strong>incandescent light bulbs</strong>, by as early as January 2009. This simple but historic step came as governments met in Bali to discuss next steps on tackling the global climate emergency. Over the past year, a number of EU countries have talked about similar bans, but Ireland is the first to act. <a href="https://p3-admin.greenpeace.org/international/en/news/features/ireland-bans-bulb071206/"> More.</a><span style="font-weight: bold;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong>November 2007: </strong>Together with other environmental groups, Greenpeace gets 1.5 million signatures of support and pushes through <strong>Argentina's first federal forest protection law</strong>. The new law includes a nationwide one-year moratorium on clearing of native forests while forest management regulations are put in place. After a year, any jurisdiction still lacking regulations will continue to be prohibited from issuing new logging and land clearing permits. The Forest Law also establishes environmental impact studies and public hearings - measures that will help protect forests where indigenous people live and small scale farmers. <a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/international/en/news/features/argentina-forest-law/"> More.</a></p>
<p><strong>May 2007: </strong>After four years of Greenpeace campaigning to bring an end to deep-sea bottom trawling, representatives from countries around the world gathered in <strong>Chile</strong> to carve out a <strong>fisheries agreement for the South Pacific region</strong>, protecting it from this incredibly destructive fishing method. From September 2007, bottom trawling vessels in the region will not be able to fish in areas that have, or are even likely to have, vulnerable marine ecosystems unless they complete an assessment showing that no damage will be caused. <a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/international/en/news/features/Landmark-for-deep-sea240507/"> More.</a><span style="font-weight: bold;">&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><strong>March 7, 2007: The New Zealand government announces cancellation of proposed coal-burning power plant</strong> Marsden B. Greenpeace and local activists had mounted a four-year struggle which involved a nine-day occupation, highcourt challenges, protest marches, a record numbers of public submissions, Surfers Against Sulphur, public meetings, and a pirate radio station. <a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/india/news/greenpeace-shuts-down-new-zeal"> More.</a> <span style="font-weight: bold;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong>February 15, 2007: In a major blow to the UK government's plans to reinvigorate nuclear power</strong>, the High Court rules their decision to back a programme of new nuclear power stations was unlawful on the basis that they had failed to adequately consult citizens and groups who oppose nuclear power as a dangerous distraction from real solutions to climate change. <a href="http://www.greenpeace.org.uk/blog/nuclear/success-as-governments-nuclear-plans-ruled-unlawful" target="_top"> More.</a></p>
<h2>2006</h2>
<p><strong>September 27, 2006: Estonia launches an investigation into the Probo Koala</strong> following three days of blockade by the Greenpeace vessel Arctic Sunrise. It is the first official action against the ship, which poisoned thousands and killed eight in the Ivory Coast when it dumped a cargo of toxic waste that had been refused by the Netherlands. After dumping its deadly cargo, the ship simply sailed to Estonia unhindered until Greenpeace took action. <a href="https://p3-admin.greenpeace.org/international/en/news/features/estonia-seizes-probo-koala-060927/"> More.</a></p>
<p><strong>July 25, 2006: McDonald's agrees to stop selling chicken fed on soya grown in newly deforested areas of the Amazon </strong>rainforest, then <strong>becomes instrumental in getting other food companies</strong> and supermarkets, such as Marks &amp; Spencer, Sainsbury's, ASDA and Waitrose, to sign up <strong>to a zero deforestation policy</strong> as well. But it goes even further than that, and pressure from all these companies&nbsp; forces their suppliers, the big multinational soya companies such as <strong>Cargill, to agree a two-year moratorium on buying soya from newly deforested areas</strong>. <a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/international/en/news/features/McVictory-200706/"> More</a></p>
<p><strong>June 26, 2006: Dell becomes the latest company to promise to remove the worst toxic chemicals from it products</strong>, closely following the move of its rival HP.

<p><strong>April 3, 2006: </strong>After months of pressure, consumer actions, online activism and more than 100,000 emails from <a href="http://oceans.greenpeace.org/en/" target="_self">Ocean Defenders</a> everywhere, seafood suppliers <strong>Gorton's, Sealord and parent company Nissui withdraw their active support for Japanese whaling</strong>. Whalers announce that the 32 percent share in whaling operations owned by these commercial corporations will be transferred to a "public interest entity." The retreat isolates whaling economically and probably scuppers plans to find new markets for whale products. <a href="https://p3-admin.greenpeace.org/international/en/news/features/victory-for-the-whales130106/"> More</a></p>

<p><strong>February 14, 2006: </strong>An area twice the size of Belgium has been given <strong>greater protection in the Amazon</strong> after a Presidential decree. The decree by President Lula of Brazil to create the 6.4 million hectare (around 16 million acres) conservation area is a great victory for the people of the Amazon battling land grabbers, cattle ranchers and loggers. The decree calls for around 1.6 million hectares to be permanently protected and totally off limits to logging and deforestation. <a href="https://p3-admin.greenpeace.org/international/en/news/features/samba-forest-147369/"> More</a></p>
<p><strong>February 7, 2006: </strong>Take ten years of difficult, dangerous, and at times, heartbreaking work. Add thousands of activists from around the world -- some who sent emails, some who stood on the blockades, some who voted against destruction with their wallets.&nbsp; Some who were beaten, some who were sued, some who were arrested. But eventually common sense has prevailed and one of the world's treasures, the <strong>Great Bear Rainforest, is saved from destruction</strong>. <a href="https://p3-admin.greenpeace.org/international/en/news/features/great-bear-saved-123987/"> More</a></p>
<p><strong>January 13, 2006: </strong>Our Argentine Ocean Defenders hit Nissui in their pockets. Nissui own about one third of Kyodo Senpaku -- the people who run the Japanese whaling fleet.

<p><strong>June 10, 2004:</strong> Publishers of <strong>34 Canadian magazines pledged to shift away from paper containing tree fibre from Canada's ancient forests</strong> thanks to ongoing pressure from the Markets Initiative coalition, of which Greenpeace Canada has a key role. The coalition has similar commitments from <strong>71 Canadian book publishers</strong> including the Canadian publisher of Harry Potter, which printed the Order of the Phoenix on AFF paper in June 2003. Greenpeace Canada's work to protect its forests also encouraged <strong>Cascades</strong>, as the second largest producer of tissue products in Canada <strong>to commit to an Ancient Forest-Friendly purchasing policy</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>June 1, 2004: Iceland steps back from plans to kill 500 minke, sei, and fin <a indepth="true" href="default_057.html">whales</a> over two years</strong>, announcing a quota of only 25 minkes for the year. Greenpeace web activists fueled domestic opposition by gathering 50,000 worldwide signatures to a pledge to visit Iceland if the government would stop whaling. With a potential value of more than US$ 60 million in tourist spend, against a whaling programme which generated 3-4 million in profits, the pledge dramatically <strong>illustrated that whales are worth more to Iceland alive than dead</strong>. <a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/international/en/press/releases/iceland-abandons-major-part-of/"> More</a></p>
<p><strong>May 11, 2004:</strong> Thanks to years of pressure from environmental groups, the consumers, our cyberactivists and Greenpeace, we can celebrate a victory for the environment following the announcement by <strong>Monsanto</strong> that it would <strong>suspend further development or open field trials of its genetically engineered Roundup Ready wheat</strong>. Monsanto stated that it was deferring all further efforts to introduce the crop and that it was discontinuing breeding and field-level research of the wheat.

<p><strong>March 31, 2004:</strong> Following the controversial UK government approval of genetically engineered (GE) maize for commercial planting,<strong> the only company authorized to grow GE maize withdraws its application</strong>. In a victory for activists and consumers across Europe who lobbied for tougher legislation and boycotted GE products, <strong>Bayer Crop science</strong>, a German company authorised to plant an herbicide-resistant variety of maize known as Chardon LL, said regulations on how and where the crop could be planted would make it "economically non-viable." Chardon LL was the crop pulled up by Greenpeace UK activists in 1999.
